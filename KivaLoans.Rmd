## Kiva Loans

Kiva loans are extremely small loans, called microloans, made to entrepreneurs who need small seed loans to start their businesses. The loans are made in order to help better communities one entrepreneur at a time. The dataset used in this vignette consists of a set of Kiva loans made in calendar year 2016 around the globe. For the purpose of this vignette, the loans data was pared down to make the file size < 25 MB.
```{r }
kiva <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/douglasbarley/FALL2020TIDYVERSE/TidyverseVignette/kiva_loans.csv")

library(tidyverse)
glimpse(kiva)
```

The 2016 data includes 197,236 observations of 14 variables.

## Tidyverse group_by() function

The Tidyverse contains many packages that are useful in R for cleaning and exploring data. When faced with a fairly long dataset, such as the Kiva set in this example, it is useful to be able to count the data in a single column while grouping the counts according to discrete values in that column. The `group_by` function in the `dplyr` corner of the Tidyverse helps to do just that. This helps a programmer quickly explore what is in the data.

For example, it could be useful to know which countries received the most loans.
```{r message= FALSE}
countries <- data.frame(kiva) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
      summarize(count_loans = n())

head(countries)
```

## Visualizing the results

Once we have a concise count of loans by country, it is helpful to be able to visualize
all of the results in a single graphic. The `ggplot()` function, also part of the Tidyverse, is very helpful in
the visualization realm.
```{r}
ggplot(data = countries) + geom_col(aes(x = country, y = count_loans)) +
  ggtitle("Loans Disbursed by Country") +
  coord_flip() +  
  ylab('Loan Count') +
  xlab('Country') 

```

There are so many countries where loans were disbursed that it is difficult to read each country's name. In order to simplify the listing and visualizations, let's identify the top 10 countries that received loans.
```{r}
countries_top10 <- head(arrange(countries,desc(count_loans)), n = 10)
countries_top10
```

Now we can graph the top 10 countries that received loans.
```{r}
ggplot(data = countries_top10) + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(country, count_loans), count_loans)) +
  ggtitle("Loans Disbursed by Country") +
  coord_flip() +  
  ylab('Loan Count') +
  xlab('Country')
```

That's much more legible! Now we can see that the Philippines received the most Kiva loans of any country in 2016.

## Tidyverse EXTEND

In order to see the order of which countries received the most loans more efficiently,
we can sort the data in descending order, from greatest to least. We can use the 
`arrange` function from the `dplyr` package. It orders the rows of a data frame by
the specified column. By default, it sorts from least to greatest, so we would 
have to specify descending order. Furthermore, a `by_group` argument can be 
used if we want to group variables.

```{r}
countries <- countries %>%
  arrange(desc(count_loans))

head(countries)
```

From here, we can see that Phillipines, Kenya, and Cambodia have the most loans.


We can also look further into those countries to see what the loans were taken 
out for. To do so, we  will:

* `add_count` to create a new column and find counts of variables group-wise
  + It is equivalent to `group_by` and `mutate` used together
* `mutate` to add an extra column in the data set with ranks
* `dense_rank` to return the rank of rows 
  + It will rank the rows, in descending order, with no gaps. This means when 
    there are ties, it will give it the same rank.
* `filter` to subset rows using column values
  + In this case, we are selecting the top 5 ranks or groups with largest loan 
    counts
* `as.factor` from `base` to factor the sector column
* `group_by`, `mutate`, and `ungroup` to find the counts for each sector by 
  country
* `group_by`, `mutate`, and `ungroup` to give ranks to each sector by country
* `filter` to find the top 5 sectors for each country
* `facet_wrap` to create a graph for each country on its own


```{r}
top_5_countries <- kiva %>%
  add_count(country, name = "count_loans") %>%
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(count_loans))) %>%
  filter(rank %in% 1:5) %>%
  mutate(sector = as.factor(sector)) %>%
  group_by(country, sector) %>%
  mutate(sector_count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(sector_rank = dense_rank(desc(sector_count))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(sector_rank %in% 1:5)
  

ggplot(top_5_countries) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = sector, y = count_loans, fill = country), stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~country, scales = "free", ncol = 2) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Activities for Loans") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), legend.position = "none") +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("Sector")
```
